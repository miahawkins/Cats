	<p>Provided you have room for their essential supplies, up to two or three cats may get along quite well in a one-bedroom apartment. Of course, the human of the home must do his or her part, by keeping the litter box(es) clean, and making sure uneaten wet food is disposed of promptly. 

	Bonus: As a renter, you'll likely find more apartments available to cat owners than dog owners. Landlords look more favorably on tenants with cats for several reasons:

	No cat-related noise complaints.
	No fear of cats walking the hallways, potentially harming other tenants.
	Less repair needed at move out due to stained carpet or scratched walls and doors.</p>

	<p>During its lifetime, you'll spend less money caring for a cat than a dog. You'll see a major disparity from the moment you decide to bring a cat into your home! 

	While buying a fancy cat breed can be expensive, adoption fees for cats and kittens tend to be lower than those for dogs (especially during kitten season). At some shelters, you may find that adoption fees are waived entirely.</p>
